## **BACKGROUND**

I am 18 years old and have recently graduated from highschool. I'm a 3rd generation Australian and my cultural background is Lebanese. I am fluent in both English and Arabic and practicing German. I think maybe the most interesting fact about me is that I listen to heaps of music (mainly rock) and I have like over 6000 songs. I suppose it's interesting because people are always surprised when I tell them the type of music I listen to, mainly because I don't look like I listen to that kind of stuff (people low-key think I listen to that "typical millenial music"). I'm also an Apple Enthusiast :)

## **INTEREST IN IT** 

My interest in IT is basically everything to do with IT, there's no specific part I like more. The things that pushed me to pursue IT were the friends I hung out with when I was in school. They all had a particular interest in IT and I guess you could say they greatly influenced and introduced me to this amazing subject. I don't have any spectacular IT experience apart from the fact that I am the go-to person at home for all the family's IT needs, but I am enrolled in this course as well as *Introduction to Programming* so I can develop my skills and hopefully learn more about IT and use it with confidence c:. 

**Why did you choose to come to RMIT?**

I chose to be an RMIT student because it has the degree I want to study in the way I wish for it to be delivered. RMIT has enabled me to study and be able to work at the same time, which is very accommodating for me. RMIT was also offered through OUA which I applied through and I guess I found it more appealing than the other universities. 

**What do you expect to learn during your studies?**

As mentioned above, I'm currently undertaking Intro to IT as well as Intro to Programming so I'm hoping to learn the essentials of IT as well as programming. By learning that I'm hoping to be able to implement the knowledge I gain into my daily life and use the experience to hopefully kick start my career in IT.

## **IDEAL JOB**

My ideal job is one where I would be able to manage and interact with people and assist them with all their IT needs. For that, I will require specific knowledge and experience. The reason this job appealed to me was because i'd like to do something that requires helping customers whether it be helping with devices physically or over the phone. This job requires strong knowledge and experience regarding complex IT solutions as well as experience in dealing with customers. Skills that are required in this job that I do have are strong written and verbal consulting/communication skills as well as experience in dealing with customers. The way I hope to achive the skills required for jobs like this is to continue on with the Bachelor of IT and hope to learn all the necessary skills along the way as well as practice some extra things outside of uni life. Other ways I can ready myself for a job like this would be to be as open minded and as innovative as possible in order for me to fully understand customers as well as be able to work efficiently.

The results for these tests allowed me to reflect on myself better and the type of person I am. I think that the test results clearly display what I need to improve on and what I can work off. These results may influence my behaviour in a team by allowing me to reflect on what I'm doing and implement the information present in the scores, with my interaction with other people. When forming a team, I should consider the possible outcomes/consequences I may face if I make a wrong decision or make a decision not fit for me. I also should try finding people with a different personality and different attributes to me in order for us to effectively communicate whilst learning and teaching each other new skills.




# **PROJECT IDEA**

**OVERVIEW**

My project will be about actually making flying cars rather than just reading about people’s plans on “reaching production status”. This project will require a lot of gravity defiant studies and research. The purpose of this project, is to be able to familiarise myself with tools and new tech that may be present in the discussion and creation of the Flying Car. Of course, if I was ever to actually manufacture a flying car, I wouldn’t make it as expensive as the estimated or fixed prices are. I’d make it affordable enough so that whoever is able to get it, will be able to. 

**MOTIVATION**

I suppose my motivation for this project came from the many times I’ve been stuck in traffic and got super annoyed to the point where I wished that flying cars were actually existent. This project will definitely be interesting because it’s a flying car! I mean who doesn’t want a flying car? Ron Weasley, thanks for the idea! This will be very useful to everyone as it will allow people to travel quicker and more efficiently without having to get caught in traffic on the way to work or wherever else they may be heading. Also, there are roof parkings for a reason, so why not use them for flying cars hmm?

**GENERAL DESCRIPTION**

The flying car is a modern method of transportation that requires either specific training or an experienced pilot to fly it. There are positives and negatives as there is in almost everything in the world. So naturally, the issues need to be addressed. The positives outweigh the negatives of this project, positives being the efficiency of the flying car and the many advanced features it has. The flying car will be a relaibale and common method of transportation in a few years' time due to the fact that it is a preferred method among many people. I know I would prefer a flying car any day! There are still so many positives aspects of the flying car, especially the Hybrid-Electric motor which is very environmentally friendly and fuel efficient. The voice and facial recognition are probably one of the best features of the car purely because they provide an immense amount of security so that only one person can get in and out of the car. The negatives of the car is that floating or holographic traffic lights and signals have not yet been created so the sky may be chaotic. Also, the care requires a lot of space for take-off. The car will have the best quality tints on the window and also paint colour of the driver's choice. Flight mode will be enabled when there is a clear and straight road and will require a great speed in order for a smooth lift off. 

**DESCRIPTION - FEATURES**

The features of this product includes:
-	A Hybrid-Electric motor which uses an internal combustion engine and a lithium iron phosphate battery which is scientifically proven to be safer than other lithium batteries. 
-	The car also has a built in, voice activated, hands free navigation system for easy and safe use as well as a boost. The throttle integrates the boost feature for an exciting burst of extra power whilst flying. 
-	Full frame parachute which assists the plane to land safely if a system failure occurs and the plane stops functioning
-	Safety systems that include three rear view mirrors in drive mode and improved seatbelts for extra security whilst in drive or flight mode. 
-	Rotary engine for ultimate performance paired with the Hybrid-Electric motor. 
-	Automatic windscreen wipers with rain sensor
-	ABS brakes to prevent the wheels on the car from sliding and could potentially prevent many accidents. 
-	Automatic lock for enhanced security 
-	Bluetooth connections
-	Reverse camera 
- Built-in subwoofers and speaker system
- Built-in camera on the windscreen to detect suspicious movement while the car is parked as well as record live road/air situations. 
- Automatic light sensors 
- LED Headlights 72W 6600LM COB
- Key-less ignition
- Top of the range leather seats 
- Automatic windows
- Glossy/matte paint finish
- Tinted windows

**TOOLS/TECH**

The tools and tech that are present in the flying car, are split into two categories: hardware and software. The hardware for this flying car is the engine. The flying car uses a rotary engine as well as a Hybrid-Electric motor for that modern, advanced and futuristic feel. The software present would be facial and voice recognition which have components of Artificial Intelligence, tools to detect the facial features of the driver for extra security. 

**SKILLS REQUIRED**

Some of the skills needed for this project to work is obviously flight experience. Another skill needed would be the ability to control the voice activated intelligence system that utilises AI. The most common software used to write the code for voice and facial recognition include: Python, MATLAB, C++, PHP, JAVA, C# and Perl. 

Being able to find the software and hardware components may not be easy, the same way it is not easy to find someone who has the experience to be able to program the car. The feasibility of the skills is not very high but it is not impossible. 

**STATISTICS**

In 2017, a survey was conducted in an American University (University of Michigan) on their preferences for flying cars. The results show that almost half are ready to use and travel by air in the car. Out of the 508 adults that were asked, 221 showed a lot of interest in a self-driving car. Though, the majority of people in all age groups that were asked, voted to let the robot driver take them to the places whereas only 81 said that they were interesting in a flying taxi that would be driven by a qualified and licensed pilot. 

**OUTCOME**

If this project is successful, the outcome will be a more efficient method of transportation and a definitely safer way that it is currently. This product will be the future of cars and hopefully inspire some greater inventions or perhaps inspire the idea of inventing a hybrid train or bus. This development will impact society greatly due to the advanced and innovative idea of making flying transport other than an airplane or helicopter. I think that this development has the potential to change lives for good whether it be now or 20 years from now, people will be grateful for flying cars.
