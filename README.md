## **BACKGROUND**

I am 18 years old and have recently graduated from highschool. I'm a 3rd generation Australian and my cultural background is Lebanese. I am fluent in both English and Arabic and practicing German. I think maybe the most interesting fact about me is that I'm a huge fan of I Prevail, Bring Me The Horizon, Rage Against the Machine, Of Mice & Men and $uicideBoy$, and that I also listen to heaps of other random music preferably rock, metal and the occasional rap. I guess it's interesting because people are always surprised when I tell them the type of music I listen to, mainly because I don't look like I listen to that kind of stuff. I also have an adorable *cough cough* Ragdoll kitty who's named Caesar after Julius Caesar.  

## **Interests in IT** 

My interest in IT is basically everything to do with IT, there's no specific part I like more. The things that pushed me to pursue IT were the freinds I hung out with when I was in school. They all had a particular interest in IT and I guess you could say they influenced me. I don't have any particular IT experience but I am enrolled in this course as well as *Introduction to Programming* so I can develop my skills and hopefully learn more about IT. 

**Why did you choose to come to RMIT?**

I chose to be an RMIT student because it has the degree I want to study. It is also very accomodating for me because it offers online study. It's true that I don't reside in Melbourne but RMIT has enabled me to study and be able to work.

**What do you expect to learn during your studies?**

As mentioned above, I'm currently undertaking Intro to IT as well as Intro to Programming so I'm hoping to learn the essentials of IT as well as programming. By learning that I'm hoping to be able to implement the knowledge I gain into my daily life and use the experience to hopefully kick start my career in IT.

## **Ideal Job**
