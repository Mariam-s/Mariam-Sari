## **BACKGROUND**

I am 18 years old and have recently graduated from highschool. I'm a 3rd generation Australian and my cultural background is Lebanese. I am fluent in both English and Arabic and practicing German. I think maybe the most interesting fact about me is that I'm a huge fan of I Prevail, Bring Me The Horizon, Rage Against the Machine, Of Mice & Men and $uicideBoy$, and that I also listen to heaps of other random music preferably rock, metal and the occasional rap. I guess it's interesting because people are always surprised when I tell them the type of music I listen to, mainly because I don't look like I listen to that kind of stuff. I also have an adorable *cough cough* Ragdoll kitty who's named Caesar after Julius Caesar. :smile: 

## **My interests in IT** 

My interest in IT is basically everything to do with IT, there's no specific part I like more. The things that pushed me to pursue IT were the freinds I hung out with when I was in school. They all had a particular interest in IT and I guess you could say they influenced me. I don't have any particular IT experience but I am enrolled in this course as well as *Introduction to Programming* so I can develop my skills and hopefully learn more about IT.
