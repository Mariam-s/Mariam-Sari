## **BACKGROUND**

I am 18 years old and have recently graduated from highschool. I'm a 3rd generation Australian and my cultural background is Lebanese. I am fluent in both English and Arabic and practicing German. I think maybe the most interesting fact about me is that I'm a huge fan of I Prevail, Bring Me The Horizon, Rage Against the Machine, Of Mice & Men and $uicideBoy$, and that I also listen to heaps of other random music preferably rock, metal and the occasional rap. I guess it's interesting because people are always surprised when I tell them the type of music I listen to, mainly because I don't look like I listen to that kind of stuff. I also have an adorable *cough cough* (not really though he's a little bit odd :o) Ragdoll kitty who's named Caesar after Julius Caesar.  

## **INTEREST IN IT** 

My interest in IT is basically everything to do with IT, there's no specific part I like more. The things that pushed me to pursue IT were the freinds I hung out with when I was in school. They all had a particular interest in IT and I guess you could say they influenced me. I don't have any particular IT experience but I am enrolled in this course as well as *Introduction to Programming* so I can develop my skills and hopefully learn more about IT. 

**Why did you choose to come to RMIT?**

I chose to be an RMIT student because it has the degree I want to study. It is also very accomodating for me because it offers online study. It's true that I don't reside in Melbourne but RMIT has enabled me to study and be able to work.

**What do you expect to learn during your studies?**

As mentioned above, I'm currently undertaking Intro to IT as well as Intro to Programming so I'm hoping to learn the essentials of IT as well as programming. By learning that I'm hoping to be able to implement the knowledge I gain into my daily life and use the experience to hopefully kick start my career in IT.

## **IDEAL JOB**

My ideal job is one where I would be able to interact people and assist them with all their IT needs. For that, I will require specific knowledge and experience. The reason this job appealed to me was because i'd like to do something that requires helping customers whether it be helping with devices phyically or over the phone. This job requires strong knowledge and experience regarding complex IT solutions as well as experience in dealing with customers, which I have. Skills that are required in this job that I do have are strong written and verbal consulting/communication skills. The way I hope to achive the skills required for jobs like this is to continue on with the Bachelor of IT and hope to learn all the necessary skills along the way as well as practice some extra things outside of uni life.

### **Online learning-style test results**

### **Other online test**

The results for these tests allowed me to reflect on myself better and the type of person I am. I think that the test results clearly display what I need to improve on and what I can work off. These results may influence my behaviour in a team by allowing me to reflect on what I'm doing and implement the information present in the scores, with my interaction with other people. When forming a team, I should consider the possible outcomes/consequences I may face if I make a wrong decision or make a decision not fit for me. I also should try finding people with different a personality and different attributes to me in order for us to effectively communicate whilst learning and teaching each other new skills.




#**PROJECT IDEA**

**OVERVIEW**



**MOTIVATION**

I suppose my motivation for this project came from the many times I’ve been stuck in traffic and got super annoyed to the point where I wished that flying cars were actually existent. This project will definitely be interesting because it’s a flying car! I mean who doesn’t want a flying car? Ron Weasley, thanks for the idea! This will be very useful to everyone as it will allow people to travel quicker and more efficiently without having to get caught in traffic on the way to work or wherever else they may be heading. Also, there are roof parkings for a reason, so why not use them for flying cars hmm?
