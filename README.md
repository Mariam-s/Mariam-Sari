## **BACKGROUND**

I am 18 years old and have recently graduated from highschool. I'm a 3rd generation Australian and my cultural background is Lebanese. 
I'm going to start by listing some facts about what I like. I am a huge fan of I Prevail, Bring Me The Horizon, Rage Against the Machine, Of Mice & Men and $uicideBoy$. I also listen to heaps of other random music preferably rock, metal and the occasional rap.

**My interests in IT**
